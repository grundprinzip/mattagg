Material Aggregation
--------------------

This is a small sample project to simulate diverse access patterns
either on a column store or a row store. The most important class is
the Table class. It provides simple methods to access a certain value
at a given position ( col, row).

How To Use?

Genrate Data
-----------

In the data subfolder is a generator script that will generate the
necessary data to execute all tasks. The distribution of this data is
close to real customer data. 

To generate data you will need the following parameters:

   - number of rows 
   - number of distinct values ( defines the number of distinct values each fill column may have)
   - number of columns ( number of total columns including the material_id and amount column)

The output are two files one pipe ("|") separated file in this order

Data file:

     material_id | amount | [random_col]+

Index file:

     material_id | (row1,...,rown)

The index file is an inverted index meaning that it is split into two
parts, the first column identifies the material number and the second
part identifies all rows where this material number is used.
